- Check sentence openings: If 3+ consecutive sentences start the same way, vary structure
- Rotate descriptors: "sharp" → "keen" → "acute", don't reuse same adjective
- Read mentally: Does it sound repetitive? Revise.

# STYLE GUIDE: LOVECRAFT
- Archaic vocabulary: "eldritch", "cyclopean", "squamous", "antiquarian"
- Long, labyrinthine sentences with nested clauses
- First-person perspective with academic/observer tone [NOTE: Use third-person limited here]
- Suggest horror through description, don't show directly
- Build atmosphere through adjective layering

# CONTEXT
In the heart of Chicago's seething underbelly, Detective Sarah Mitchell prowled the rain-slicked streets, her sharp green eyes scanning for truth in a city built on lies. Her mentor, the grizzled Captain Tom Harris, had taught her that justice was a luxury few could afford, but Sarah refused to accept that bitter wisdom.

The case that consumed her nights involved Marcus Kane, the city's most dangerous man hiding behind a badge. Kane's corruption ran deep - from the mayor's office to the docks where bodies washed up with disturbing frequency. Sarah knew he was responsible for her partner's death, but proving it meant going against the entire department.

Enter Jack Romano, the idealistic prosecutor who believed the system could still work. He'd become Sarah's unlikely ally, his boyish optimism a sharp contrast to her hardened cynicism. Together, they built their case brick by careful brick.

But Kane had allies too. His enforcer, the sadistic Vincent Cross, left a trail of terror wherever he went. And Kane's ex-wife, the mysterious Elena Volkov, held secrets that could destroy them all - if she could be convinced to talk.

## Example 5: Dialogue Enhancement

### Scenario
- Task: Improve dialogue in existing scene
- Focus: Make voices distinctive, add subtext
- Provider: Venice.ai

### Full Prompt

```markdown
# ROLE
You are a dialogue specialist enhancing character voices and subtext.

# TASK
Rewrite ONLY the dialogue in this scene to make it sharper, more distinctive, and layered with subtext.

# CRITICAL RULES
1. PRESERVE: Keep exact same events, actions, and plot beats
2. CHANGE: Only dialogue and dialogue tags/beats
3. VOICES: Each character must sound unique (see profiles below)
4. SUBTEXT: Characters have hidden agendas - surface meaning ≠ true meaning
5. NATURAL: Real people interrupt, trail off, speak in fragments, use filler words
6. CONFLICT: Underlying tension: Eleanor suspects Victor is withholding information about the cult

# CHARACTER VOICE PROFILES

Eleanor Marsh:
- Speech pattern: Academic, uses complex vocabulary, speaks in complete sentences when calm
- Vocabulary: Educated, uses archaic terms from her research, Latin phrases
- Speech tells: Fragments when stressed, pedantic when defensive, uses professor tone
- Current emotion: Anxious, suspicious, obsessive
- Hidden agenda: Testing if Victor knows more than he's saying

Victor Chen:
- Speech pattern: Cop-speak, short sentences, direct and blunt
- Vocabulary: Working-class, police jargon, avoids flowery language
- Speech tells: Dry humor to deflect, goes silent when conflicted, avoids eye contact when lying
- Current emotion: Protective, concerned, hiding something
- Hidden agenda: Knows his captain is part of the cult, can't tell Eleanor yet

# DIALOGUE QUALITY CHECKLIST
✓ Each character has DISTINCT voice (word choice, rhythm, formality)
✓ Subtext layered in every exchange (what they mean vs what they say)
✓ Interruptions and overlaps feel natural ("Wait, I—" "No, listen—")
✓ Body language punctuates dialogue ("He looked away. 'Fine.'")
✓ Silences are meaningful (beats of pause, trailing off)
✓ Dialogue reveals character (background, education, emotion)
✗ NO exposition dumps ("As you know, Bob...")
✗ NO perfectly formed sentences (unless that's character trait)
✗ NO everyone sounds the same
✗ NO dialogue tags every line (use action beats)

# SUBTEXT TECHNIQUE
For meaningful exchanges:
1. Character says surface statement
2. Action/reaction reveals true meaning
3. Other character responds to subtext, not surface

Example:
Eleanor: "You've been very helpful, detective." (surface: gratitude)
She closed the book with more force than necessary. (subtext: frustrated, suspicious)
Victor: "Just doing my job." He wouldn't meet her eyes. (subtext: guilt, hiding something)

# SCENE WITH WEAK DIALOGUE

Eleanor and Victor stood in the university library, surrounded by Davies' research notes spread across the table.

"What do you think about these symbols?" Eleanor asked.

"They look dangerous," Victor said.

"Yes, but what do they mean?" Eleanor pressed.

"I don't know. Maybe we should ask an expert," Victor suggested.

"I am the expert," Eleanor reminded him.

"Right, of course," Victor acknowledged.

"There's something you're not telling me," Eleanor accused.

"I'm telling you everything I know," Victor insisted.

"I don't believe you," Eleanor stated.

"That's your problem, not mine," Victor retorted.

Eleanor picked up one of the journals. "These coordinates are important."

"We should check them out," Victor agreed.

"Tomorrow," Eleanor decided.

"Fine," Victor accepted.

They left the library together in tense silence.

# OUTPUT
Same scene with enhanced dialogue. Keep all non-dialogue text unchanged.
Focus on making each voice distinct and loading subtext into exchanges.

REMEMBER:
- Eleanor speaks in complex sentences, uses academic vocabulary, fragments when stressed
- Victor uses cop-speak, short sentences, deflects with humor
- They're both hiding things from each other
- Tension should simmer beneath surface politeness

Output the scene now:
